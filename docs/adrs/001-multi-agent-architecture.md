# ADR-001: Multi-Agent System Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-01-01

## Context

Purple Merit requires an autonomous marketing system with multiple specialized agents collaborating to optimize lead management, campaign execution, and customer engagement. The system must be capable of learning and adapting from ongoing interactions to improve future marketing outreach.

## Decision

We will implement a **3-agent collaborative architecture** with the following design principles:

### Agent Specialization
1. **Lead Triage Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Categorize and score incoming leads
   - **Categories**: Campaign Qualified, General Inquiry, Cold Lead
   - **Scoring**: 0-100 scale based on source quality, company size, industry fit, engagement level, and historical performance

2. **Engagement Agent** 
   - **Purpose**: Manage personalized outreach and lead nurturing
   - **Capabilities**: Email campaigns, social media interactions, content recommendations
   - **Strategy**: Adaptive based on lead category and preferences

3. **Campaign Optimization Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Monitor campaign performance and adapt strategies
   - **Capabilities**: A/B testing, budget optimization, performance analysis
   - **Escalation**: Complex decisions escalated to human managers

### Communication Protocol
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** for inter-agent communication
- **Request-Response Pattern** for synchronous operations
- **Event Broadcasting** for async notifications
- **Message Queue** for reliable delivery

### Memory Architecture (4-Tier System)
1. **Short-term Memory** (Redis)
   - Current conversation contexts
   - TTL-based expiration (1-24 hours)
   - High-speed access for active sessions

2. **Long-term Memory** (PostgreSQL)
   - Customer history and preferences
   - Interaction patterns and outcomes
   - RFM scoring and segmentation

3. **Episodic Memory** (Vector Database - ChromaDB)
   - Successful problem-resolution patterns
   - Contextual similarity matching
   - Learning from past experiences

4. **Semantic Memory** (Neo4j Graph Database)
   - Domain knowledge relationships
   - Marketing concept connections
   - Strategy associations

### Transport Layer
- **HTTP REST API** for external integrations
- **WebSocket** for real-time agent communication
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for secure data access

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Agent Architecture
**Rejected**: Single agent handling all tasks would lack specialization and would be difficult to optimize for specific marketing functions.

### 2. Microservices without Agent Pattern
**Rejected**: Traditional microservices lack the adaptive learning and autonomous decision-making capabilities required for marketing automation.

### 3. Simple Pub/Sub Messaging
**Rejected**: Lacks the structured communication protocols needed for complex agent handoffs and context preservation.

### 4. Single Database Solution
**Rejected**: Different memory types have different access patterns and requirements that are better served by specialized storage systems.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Specialization**: Each agent can be optimized for specific marketing functions
- **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on workload
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies development and debugging
- **Adaptability**: 4-tier memory system enables sophisticated learning and adaptation
- **Reliability**: Structured handoff protocols ensure context preservation

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multi-agent system requires careful coordination and monitoring
- **Infrastructure**: Multiple databases and communication channels increase operational overhead
- **Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across memory systems requires careful design
- **Debugging**: Distributed system issues can be harder to trace and resolve

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Agent communication failures | Medium | High | Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms |
| Memory system inconsistency | Low | Medium | Use transaction patterns and eventual consistency |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Medium | Implement caching and connection pooling |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Use authentication, authorization, and encryption |

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement base agent framework with common communication patterns
- Set up MCP server with basic database access
- Establish WebSocket communication infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Agents
- Implement Lead Triage Agent with scoring algorithms
- Implement Engagement Agent with outreach capabilities
- Implement Campaign Optimization Agent with analytics

### Phase 3: Memory Systems
- Set up Redis for short-term memory
- Configure PostgreSQL for long-term storage
- Implement ChromaDB for episodic memory
- Set up Neo4j for semantic knowledge graph

### Phase 4: Integration
- Implement agent handoff protocols
- Add escalation mechanisms
- Create monitoring and alerting

### Monitoring Requirements
- Agent performance metrics (response time, success rate)
- Memory system health (connection status, query performance)
- Communication reliability (message delivery, error rates)
- Business metrics (conversion rates, lead quality scores)
